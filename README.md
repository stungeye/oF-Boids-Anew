# Boids Built Using openFrameworks

Flocking behaviour modelled using location, velocity, acceleration, and perception.

Built as a code Kata with the intent of improving my vector math skillz and increasing my experience with the [openFrameworks C++ creative coding toolkit](https://openframeworks.cc/).

## Source Code

This C++ program is written in the `setup/update/draw` [openFrameworks style](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html).

## Movement in Nature

[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) exhibit flocking behaviours in groups according to the [Rules of Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/): The Perception and Control of Separation, Alignment, Cohesion. 

This code was inspired by the [Autonomous Agents / Steering Behaviour Chapter](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) in [Daniel Shiffman's book The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com). 

I've coded boids before, including a [Ruby version](https://github.com/stungeye/Hungry-Boids-for-Shoes) and a [Processing version](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/7493/).
